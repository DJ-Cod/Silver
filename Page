  <p> You choose to walk through the silver door. You don't know why it feels right, but it does. </p>
  <p> As you open the door and walk through, you step into blinding light. </p>
  <p> It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust, but as they do you are standing in a field, and as you look back the door is gone, and your newfound speed as well. </p>
  <p> You make your way through the dandelions and the grass, and they smell so beautiful and pure. You've been underground for hours, so you forgot what fresh air felt like. </p>
  <p> As you keep walking, you see a structure in the distance, and so you start to run to it. I mean, where else could you go? </p>
  <p> As you finally make it close enough to the strucure to make out what it is, you can see that it is a castle. A very big one too. </p>
  <p> A ver large person appears at the top of the outside wall. </p>
  <p> "WHO ARE YOU" You hear their voice booming. </p>
