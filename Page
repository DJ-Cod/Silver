  <p> You choose to walk through the silver door. You don't know why it feels right, but it does. </p>
  <p> As you open the door and walk through, you step into blinding light. </p>
  <p> It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust, but as they do you are standing in a field, and as you look back the door is gone, and your newfound speed as well. </p>
  <p> You make your way through the dandelions and the grass, and they smell so beautiful and pure. You've been underground for hours, so you forgot what fresh air felt like. </p>
  <p> As you keep walking, you see a structure in the distance, and so you start to run to it. I mean, where else could you go? </p>
  <p> As you finally make it close enough to the strucure to make out what it is, you can see that it is a castle. A very big one too. </p>
  <p> A ver large person appears at the top of the outside wall. </p>
  <p> "WHO ARE YOU" You hear their voice booming. </p>
  <p> As they jump down, it seems like they are almost double your height. </p>
  <p> You try to look them in the eyes, but as you try, it feels like attemting to stare into the sun itself. </p>
  <p> This feels so weird, it all feels so backwards... like you should've been here if yu had chsen the golden door. </p>
  <p> They interrupt your thoughts with a loud shout. </p>
  <p> "I AM THE RULER OF THE WORLD, AND YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE ME??" </p>
  <p> You try to explain that you just got here, and you aren't trying to challenge them or anything, but before you can find the right words, they pull a massive battleaxe from behind them. You never notice it. </p>
  <p> As it shines in the sunlight, you take a few steps back, and they ask "WHY ARE YOU HERE," "IF NOT TO CHALLENGE ME FOR MY THRONE. </p>
  <p> "I DONT KNOW!!" you finally scream, and they lower their stance, and look at you puzzled. "Wait, did you walk through the golden door?" </p>
  <p> This is the only thing that you have heard from them that hasn't been absolute screaming, and as soon they stop you're so relieved that they did. </p>
  <p> That serene moment is broken as they scream once again: "I SAIID DID YOU WALK THROUGH THE GOLDEN DOOR!?!?" </p>
  <p> This time they do let you speak, and as you do, you get to explain that you walked through the silver door and you don't remember how you got into the cave that you started in. </p>
  <p> It seems that they've calmed down, and are now willing to help you figure things out. </p>
  <p> As you explain that you walked through the silver door to get here again, you can tell that you both have the feeling that you aren't supposed to be here, and after a little bit of deliberaltion, you both come to te conclusion that, somehow, the doors were switched. </p>
